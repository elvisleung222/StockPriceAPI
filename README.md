```
5. Checkout the Eureka dashboard: http://localhost:8761/

Instances currently registered with Eureka

|Application|AMIs|Availability Zones|Status|
|-----------|----|------------------|------|
|EUREKA-FEIGN-CLIENT|n/a (1)|(1)|UP (1) - eureka-feign-client:8000|
|STOCK-PRICE-SERVICE|n/a (2)|(2)|UP (2) - stock-price-service:8002 , stock-price-service:8001|

(_You will find three services are registered in Eureka discovery registry. In this setup, two stock-price-service instances are up for load balancing._)

6. Test the Eureka load balancing endpoint: http://localhost:8000/health/. 

Try to call this endpoint mutiple times. Then, you will see messages from TWO instances randomly with port numbers (8001 / 8002).
```
Instance "stock-price-service:8001" is running......
Instance "stock-price-service:8002" is running......
Instance "stock-price-service:8002" is running......
Instance "stock-price-service:8001" is running......
```

7. Checkout the Swagger of APIs: http://localhost:8001/swagger-ui.html
8. Run the sample Python script to insert 20 samples stock with 5 days prices data 

_(It sends API requests to Eureka Feign Client load balancer)_
```sh
# Python version 3 only
python StockPriceAPI/script/importData.py
# OR
python3 StockPriceAPI/script/importData.py
```
